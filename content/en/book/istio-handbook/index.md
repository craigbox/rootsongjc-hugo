Istio Service Mesh Advanced Practical - Master the Services in Post Kubernetes Era

[Istio](https://istio.io/zh) is a service mesh framework jointly developed by Google, IBM, Lyft, etc., and began to enter the public vision in early 2017.

[The ServiceMesher community,](https://www.servicemesher.com/) as one of the earliest open source communities in China that is researching and promoting Service Mesh technology, decided to integrate community resources and co-author an open source e-book as a service mesh think tank.
