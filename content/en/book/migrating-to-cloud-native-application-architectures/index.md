### Translator order

Cloud-native applications in the cloud era have come. Are you ready to migrate traditional monolithic applications to cloud-native architectures?

As the saying goes, "consciousness determines action", before moving to cloud native applications, we all need to have a general understanding of Cloud Native (cloud native) concept, organizational form, and technology to implement it, so as to guide our cloud Native architecture practices.

[Pivotal](https://pivotal.io/) is the author of cloud-native applications, and launched the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform) cloud-native application platform and [Spring](https://spring.io/) open source Java development framework, becoming a pioneer and pathfinder in cloud-native application architecture.

The original book was written in 2015. The examples in it are mainly for Java applications, but they are also applicable to any application type. The cloud-native application architecture is suitable for program development in heterogeneous languages, not just for Java language program development. As I translated the book, the cloud-native applications ecosystem has begun to take shape, [CNCF](https://cncf.io/) members continue to grow and develop, based on Cloud Native start-up companies emerging, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to lead the trend of container arrangement, and Service Mesh technology (such as [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) and [Istio](https://istio.io/) ) of Appears, the rise of the Go language (refer to another book, [Cloud Native Go](/en/book/cloud-native-go) ), etc., provides more options for us to migrate our applications to the cloud native architecture.

### Introduction

At present, many enterprises are adopting cloud-native application architecture, which can help their IT transformation and become a real agile force in market competition. O'Reilly's report defines the characteristics of cloud-native application architectures, such as microservices and twelve-factor applications.

The author of this book, Matt Stine, also explores the cultural, organizational, and technological changes required to migrate traditional monolithic and service-oriented architecture (SOA) applications to cloud-native architectures. There is also a migration manual in this book that contains methods for breaking monolithic applications into microservices, implementing fault tolerance models, and performing automated testing of cloud-native services.

The application architectures discussed in this book include:

- Twelve-factor application: A collection of cloud-native application architecture patterns
- Microservices: independently deployed services, each service does one thing
- Self-service agile infrastructure: a platform that provides application environments and back-office services quickly, repeatably, and consistently
- API-based collaboration: published and versioned APIs that allow interactions between services in a cloud-native application architecture
- Pressure resistance: a system that becomes stronger under pressure

### About the author
