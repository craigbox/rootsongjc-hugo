Google has many common engineering practices that cover almost all languages and projects. This document is a long-term accumulation of best practices and the result of collective experience. We make it as public as possible, and your organization and open source projects will benefit as well.

The following documents are currently included:

Google Code Review Guidelines, in fact two sets of guidelines:

- [Code Reviewer's Guide](https://jimmysong.io/eng-practices/docs/review/reviewer)
- [Code Developer Guide](https://jimmysong.io/eng-practices/docs/review/developer)

### Translator order

This repository is translated from [google / eng-practices](https://github.com/google/eng-practices) . The main content so far is Google â€™s summary of how to conduct a **Code Review** guide. Based on the title of the original Github repository, more Google engineering practices will be added later.
