Following the [Cloud Native Go](/en/book/cloud-native-go/) after yet another masterpiece on Cloud Native been boarded my writing schedule, this is Python-based services and cloud build micro-native Web applications, the title is called Cloud Native Python.

The content of this book overlaps with Cloud Native Go, and the directory structure is basically the same. The technology stack used is similar, but the content is more detailed, the pictures and steps are introduced more, and the other one I read [Kubernetes Management Design Patterns: With Docker, CoreOS Linux, and Other Platforms](https://jimmysong.io/posts/book-kubernetes-management-design-patterns/) written by Indians are very similar in style.

## Cloud Native Python Introduction

With the rapid development of business today, in order to support the rapid expansion of enterprises, it is not enough to simply use their own infrastructure. As a result, they have been pursuing the resilience of the cloud to build platforms that support highly scalable applications.

This book can help you understand everything you need to build a cloud-native application architecture with Python in one stop. In this book we first introduce you to cloud-native application architectures and what problems they can help you solve. Then you will learn how to build microservices using REST API and Python, and build a web layer in an event-driven way. Next, you will learn how to interact with data services and build web views using React, after which we will detail the security and performance of the application. Then, you will learn how to Docker containerize your services. Finally, you will learn how to deploy your application on AWS and Azure platforms. After you have deployed your application, we will end this book around a series of concepts and techniques about application troubleshooting.

## What is covered in this book

- Chapter 1 introduces cloud-native application architecture and microservices, discusses the basic concepts of cloud-native architecture, and builds application development environments.
- Chapter 2 uses Python to build microservices, build your own microservices knowledge base, and expand based on your use cases.
- Chapter 3 uses Python to build web applications, build an initial web application, and integrate with microservices.
- Chapter 4, Interacting with Data Services, teaches you how to migrate applications to different database services.
- Chapter 5 Building Web Views with React.
- Chapter 6 uses Flux to create extensible UIs to help you understand how to use Flux to create extensible applications.
- Chapter 7, Event Tracing and CQRS, discusses how to store contracts in the form of events.
- Chapter 8 Protect Web Applications from External Threats.
- Chapter 9 is related to continuous delivery and frequent application releases.
- Chapter 10, Docker Containerizing Your Services, discusses container services and running applications in Docker.
- Chapter 11 Deploying Applications to the AWS Platform teaches you how to build infrastructure on AWS and set up a production environment for your applications.
- Chapter 12, Deploying Applications to the Azure Platform, discusses how to build infrastructure on Azure and set up a production environment for your applications.
- Chapter 13, Monitoring Cloud Applications, understands monitoring tools for different infrastructures and applications.

## What tools and environments do you need to use this book

You need to have Python installed on your system. A text editor, preferably Vim, Sublime or Notepad ++. In one chapter you need to download POSTMAN, a powerful API test suite that can be installed as a Chrome extension. You can [download](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) it from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) .

In addition, if you have the following website account, it is even better:

- Jenkins
- Docker
- Amazon Web Services
- Terraform

## Target audience

This book is intended for developers who have a basic knowledge of Python and are familiar with the basic principles of the command line and HTTP-based applications. This book is ideal for those who want to learn how to build, test, and extend applications developed in Python. No previous experience in building microservices with Python is required.
