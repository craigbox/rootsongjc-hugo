### Serverless Handbook - A practical manual for serverless architecture

Serverless (serverless architecture) means that the server-side logic is implemented by the developer, the application runs in a stateless computing container, is triggered by events, and is completely managed by a third party, and its business-level state is stored in a database or other medium.

Serverless is an advanced stage in the development of cloud-native technologies that allows developers to focus more on business logic and reduce their focus on infrastructure.
