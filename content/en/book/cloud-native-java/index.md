This is the third Cloud Native technical book I translated. The first two are:

- [Cloud Native Go Chinese version](/en/book/cloud-native-go/)
- [Cloud Native Python Chinese version](/en/book/cloud-native-python/)

## Book Introduction

What's the difference between a traditional business and those like Amazon, Netflix and Etsy? These companies have well-established cloud-native development methods that allow them to stay ahead of their competitors. This practical guide shows Java / JVM developers how to build software faster and better with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry.

Many organizations have set foot in the areas of cloud computing, test-driven development, microservices, and continuous integration and delivery. The authors of this book, Josh Long and Kenny Bastani, will take you deeper into these tools and methods and help you transform traditional applications into true cloud native applications.

This book contains the following four sections:

- **Basics** : Understand the motivations behind cloud-native thinking; configure and test Spring Boot applications; migrate your traditional applications to the cloud
- **Microservices** : use HTTP to build HTTP and RESTful services; route requests in distributed systems; establish edge services closer to data
- **Data integration** : Use Spring Data to manage data and integrate distributed services with the event-driven, message-centric architecture supported by Spring
- **Production** : Make your system observable; use service agents to connect to stateful services; understand the important ideas behind continuous delivery

If you are building a cloud native application, this book will be the basic guide to using the Java ecosystem. This book contains everything-the key tasks of building resilient services, managing data flow (through REST and asynchronous events), testing, deployment, and observability.

**——Daniel Bryant** , software developer and CTO of SpectoLabs

I predict that whether it is a cloud-native journey or a cloud-native goal, everyone involved will benefit from this cloud-native Java insight and experience.

**-Dr. Dava Syer** , contributor to Spring Framework, contributor and co-founder of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud

## author information

**Josh Long** is a Spring evangelist, editor of InfoQ.com's Java queue, and lead author of several books including Spring Recipes Second Edition (published by Apress). Josh has spoken at many international industry conferences, including TheServiceSide Java Symposium, SpringOne, OSCON, JavaZone, Devoxx, Java2Days, and more. When he was not writing SpringSource code, he was either in the Java user group or drinking coffee in a coffee shop. Josh likes solutions that drive technology forward. His interests include scalability, BPM, grid computing, mobile computing, and so-called "smart" systems.
